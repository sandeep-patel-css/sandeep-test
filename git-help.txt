To add local repo file to the github:
	$ git add .
	# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit

	$ git commit -m 'First commit'
	# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository

	$ git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
	# Sets the new remote
	$ git remote -v
	# Verifies the new remote URL

	$ git push origin master
	# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin

To pull the files added on the github after initial clone:
	$ git pull

To remove any file from local repo: (you still need to add, commit and push this change to the origin)
	$ git rm "file-name-here"
